 ## Problem Statement 
 
 Every newbie entering college has to face an initial period of hustle
 where he's confused as to where he can get all important goods
 required for his day to day life. He wanders around for stuff like
 books(required for his curriculum), drafters, calculators etc. Eventually
 after a long series of interrogations from various seniors when he
 finally buys those stuff he realises that he has been fooled and he
 could have bought them at a much lower price from someone else. By
 the time this happens a month of college already withers away. At the
 same time when a guy moves from the 1st to the 2nd year there are
 alot of things which become useless to him. For example- a guy in the
 1st year needs bicycle which a 4th year student has no use of.

 ## Our Solution
 
 Our website provides a common platform for the sellers and the buyers
 where the sellers put up goods for sale. The buyer can find the best
 price for a particular item(our webiste will sort goods according to
 prices as well). By this, the buyers no longer need to keep moving from
 senior to senior looking for goods which he needs. He can buy them
 directly through our website and that too at the best price. How
 efficient would it be that goods be recycled within the same place
 preventing newbies the pain of buying new goods at hefty prices.
 This is applicable to all colleges on a large scale. How cool would it be
 if every college has its own e-commerce website. Most of the colleges
 are located away from cities and for buying things
 noone would consider taking the pain of travelling a long distance all
 the way to the cities. He/she would want to get it sold or bought within
 the campus itself.

 ## Technologies Used
 
 - **Frontend** - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

 - **Backend** - Node.js, Express, mongoDB

 - **External Public APIs** - Stripe Payments

## Functionality

So, what we actually want to achieve is that as soon as someone
browses our website, the user will be asked to enter his/her college
name. As soon as he/she finds his college the user presses enter and
he/she is redirected to his own college portal i.e., the college’s own e-
commerce website where he/she can buy and sell products. As of
now(31/10/2018), the website is available for just one college. We
haven’t hosted it yet. But it would hosted as soon as the payment
gateway is ready for use.
